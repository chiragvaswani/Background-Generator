# Background-Generator

Background Generator can be quite useful when we wish to test certain gradient patterns out. 

It is implemented using JavaScript and has 2 options - 
1. Choosing the colors for the gradient
2. Creating a random gradient pattern

For the 2 choices, I've created 3 functions - 
1. For setting the background to match the colors the user has selected
2. For generating random integers from 0 to 255
3. For setting the background to match the random integers that were generated

Finally, the CSS for setting the background to the gradient is also displayed.
